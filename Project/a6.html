					  <br> According to Interaction Design Foundation, personas are fictional characters, 
					  which you create based upon your research in order to represent the different user 
					  types that might use your service, product, site, or brand in a similar way. These 
					  fictional characters will help us on how we will design our project. We can use them 
					  to analyze the needs, experiences, goals and behaviors of our target users.</p>
					  <p class = "blogger"> Here are the following Personas that we created using Hubspot:</p>
