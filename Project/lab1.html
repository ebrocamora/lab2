<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p style = "font-size: 100%; font-family: courier; border: 3px dotted White;color: white; background-color: #FF1493;padding:20px;">  <br>Good day! My name is <b>Eunace Rocamora</b> and you can call me <b>Nace</b> or just <b>Eunace</b>. I live in Parañaque City. I graduated both junior and senior high school at Parañaque National High School – Main. I am one of the scholars of “Tatang” (Henry SY). I take the scholarship examination here in Asia Pacific College. <br> <img src = "eunace.jpg" style="width:350px;height:300px; margin-left:300px;"> <br>SM Scholarship was not actually my first choice or the scholarship that I really want, it was just my second choice. The scholarship that I really want is the DOST Scholarship not just because of the incentives that I am going receive but the recognition when I graduated as a DOST Scholar. <br><img src = "sm.jpg" style = "width:200px;height:200px;margin-left:250px;">         <img src = "dost.jpg" style = "width:200px;height:200px"><br>Unfortunately, I didn’t pass the DOST Scholarship examination. When the page of DOST posted the list of people who pass the examination, the moment that I reach the end part of list and I did not see my name written there. I really feel so down, I feel that I am not smart enough to qualify as a DOST Scholar. Few days after the result of DOST examination, I got an email from SM foundation that I will be taking the Scholarship examination on February 3,2018. I actually forgot that I pass my requirements to the website of SM Foundation. I got a thought that maybe DOST Scholarship was not really for me and there will be a better scholarship for me. I took the examination here in Asia Pacific College, and YES! I pass the examination and interview. <br><br> One month after the examination, I got a call from Miss Ling and she said that I was chosen as one of the scholars who will give their testimonies. I was so shock and so happy. I realize that sometimes we do not get what we really want because God wants us to realize that we should not only focus on only one opportunity.<br><br>I expect that Miss Arroyo will teach us how to make Graphical User Interface in our codes. I also expect that this class will be fun and exciting.</p>
