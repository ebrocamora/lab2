		<strong><h2>Reflection #1</h2></strong>
		<h3>First Week of USERDES Class</h3>
		<p>
		<font size = "5" text-indent: "20px">	Last week was lit because it was the first week of meeting miss Jen wherein, I thought that miss Jen was like the other professors who is so strict. But when she introduces herself, the tone or the way she speaks is just like she was talking to her friends that has the same age as hers. I like that way she approaches and vice versa. 
	In terms of the subject, at first, I was surprised because USERDES class is about designing an application for the users benefit but the first thing that she made us do is to write about ourselves and make an introduction. That write up was followed by a write up again about our favorite application she even made us present it in front of the class. But miss Jen explained to us why she made us write and the only thing that I get about what she said is that writing is important in designing whether an application or website because the content is more important than the design, yes, you have the most beautiful, attractive, and amazing website but the content are nonsense or the content was not prioritize because of the design.
	I hope that throughout the term, I will learn or understand what does the user needs in a certain application and website. I also expect that miss Jen will stay the same as she is because it makes confident to speak and answer her question.</font>

		<strong><h3>Need Finding and Paper Prototyping</h3></strong>
		<p>
		<font size = "5" text-indent: "20px">	Need finding is important in developing an application. It sums up the problems that we want to solve. Actually, for me, this is one of the most difficult part when developing an application because how would you know if the application that you are developing really solves a specific problem. Miss Jen told us that Google Glass failed because it cost a thousand dollar, but it does not really solve a specific problem, it was just like the other regular glasses but with cool specifications.
	When we present the need finding or the problem that we want to solve by our project, Miss Jen criticize it to the highest level (huhuhuhu) that we ended up thinking for another project but then our leader decided to stick to our project and know we need to modify or think a very good reason why the problem that we think is really a problem. I know it is hard to think of a problem if only few people realize that it was really a problem that we need to solve.
	Paper prototyping is quite hard because we are going to do it as a group but not everyone in the group will participate. But on the other hand, this activity will help us visualize the user interface of our application. This will give us an idea if the application we will be developing is worth the time of the users.
	Overall, this week is kind a stressful but not with this subject because we do not have an examination. This subject will only require us to think critically and be genuinely happy (I don’t know if I am going to experience this hahaha kidding).

		<strong><h3>First Web Application using Github and Heroku</h3></strong>
		<p>
		<font size = "5" text-indent: "20px">	
		This week’s task is to create a web application using Github and Heroku. At first, I thought that it was too easy because I have a little background in HTML, but I was wrong. When I started creating my web application, I can’t achieve the design that I want for my web app. I still need to search in the internet on how to add padding in my content so that it will look like a very good web app. After that, I have a new problem and it is in the Github, I don’t know how to commit and push in the Github because it was my first time to use it. Now, I need to search again on how to create repository, commit, and push. I am so happy when my files appeared in the website of Github yeheeyyy hahahha. After committing and pushing in Github now I am in the phase of connecting my web app to Heroku. The process was smooth until I reach the building part of my web application. It always says pushing problems, but I push it right because I saw in the youtube how to commit and push in Github. I got frustrated because I don’t know what to do but luckily one of my classmates (Christian Dinglasan) share to us that we need to change the file type of our HTML file into PHP (Thank you Ding!). When I did it, the building phase in Heroku was successful and my web application run in Heroku (yeeeheeeyyy).
	This week’s task makes me realize that my knowledge is not enough, and I need to do some effort for me to grow. It also makes me realize that self-exploration is good because you are learning by yourself and it feels good when you accomplish something that is worth it.

		<strong><h3>Userinyerface - Worst UI Practice</h3></strong>
		<p>
		<font size = "5" text-indent: "20px">	
		At first, I didn't know that we have a quiz on that day. When I enter the room, my classmates asked me if I study last night because we have a quiz today. I asked them if miss Jen announce that we have a quiz for today but grrrrr they said that miss Jen announced it in Trello. That moment I hated technology because even though there was no announcement in class but there is a technology wherein the professors can make last minute announcement (sorry about this miss I’m just trying to be honest because this is a reflection paper, please don’t hate me). When I read the announcement in Trello, I immediately read things in the reading list, but I didn’t understand a thing.
When miss Jen arrives, she announces that we have a surprise quiz and I was like yea surprise. After 10 minutes she made us visit a link. The name of the website is Userinyerface, her instruction is just finish what is said in the web. I am so pissed-off because I do not know what to do, I click everything but still I cannot upload a picture and I accidentally refresh the page and yea I need to start over again. When I am in the last step, my English vocabulary was tested because all pictures represent the word that is given, it took me 3 minutes to realize that all the pictures need to be checked because all of them are the answer.
This surprise quiz taught me a lesson that we should be calm in everything that we are doing because when we are calm, we can think carefully and analyze things critically in order for us to answer the question accurately as possible. It also teaches me that bad user interface can make your users irritated and angry because that is what I felt when I am in the process of doing the steps. We should design our projects user-friendly that understands the needs, goals, experience, and behaviors of our users.
