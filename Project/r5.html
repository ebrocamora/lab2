						  <p class = "blogger">The SoCIT Fest was lit üî•.  I am one of the organizers of some events in the SoCIT Fest because I am the vice-president internal of JPCS ‚Äì APC and a trainee of JISSA ‚Äì APC. The experience is stressful but it was all worth it when I saw the participants happy when they are in the event that I take part to organize. SoCIT night is one of the most stressful events but it is also the one that is so amazing. The reason why I said that it was stressful because it was spearheaded by all four organizations namely JISSA, JPCS, MSC, and GG which is so hard because you need to consult everyone in the organizations for every action that you will make which is inefficient. There are also conflicts raised between organizations but I am hoping that things will going to be alright. It was amazing because I enjoy the bands that performed their songs and the foods that they prepare for us. <br><br>
						  I love the series of seminars that are spearheaded by the SoCIT organizations. There are seminars that the APC- MSC spearheaded that makes me amazed of what technology that Microsoft has, like the HoloLens of Microsoft, at first, I thought it was just like the google glass. I asked the speaker what is the difference of HoloLens and google glass, he said that google glass is just the extension of your phone, it was just projecting what is in your phone, while the HoloLens is giving us another technology or platform that we can enjoy, it was far from the UI of our phones. Another thing that I want about HoloLens is that it solves problems unlike the google wherein there's no specific problem that it is solving. One of the example problems that the HoloLens is solving is in the medical field, when a doctor is performing an operation, he can use the HoloLens to know the location of the organs that he will be operating. <br><br>
						  For me, SoCIT Fest for this year is good because I am one of the organizers and experienced how difficult it is to handle an event. It was all just for me, but I heard some comments about the SoCIT Fest that is negative like ‚Äúdi ko ramdam SoCIT Fest‚Äù which I understand because it is our first time to handle an event without the supervisions of our seniors.</p>
